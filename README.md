# Erdos_2022_ClinicalTrialsProject

[Erdos Proposed Timeline]

WEEK 2: May 16 – May 20

Data gathering and defining stakeholders + KPIs

Find the dataset you will be working with
Describe the dataset and the problem you are looking to solve (1 page max)
List the stakeholders of the project and company key performance indicators (KPIs) (bullet points)

Data cleaning + preprocessing

Look for missing values and duplicates
Basic data manipulation & preliminary feature engineering
No formal requirements, but come with questions! 

WEEK 3: May 23 – May 27

Exploratory data analysis + visualizations

Distributions of variables, looking for outliers, etc.
Descriptive statistics

Written proposal of modeling approach

Test linearity assumptions
Dimensionality reductions (if necessary)
Describe your planned modeling approach, based on the exploratory data analysis from the last two weeks (< 1 page, bullet points)
Your modeling based on the KPIs you identified a few weeks ago

WEEK 4: May 30 – June 3

Machine learning model(s) or equivalent

Results with visualizations and/or metrics
List of successes and pitfalls

June 3: Final Project Due - Submitted Directly to Erdos website 

Presentation video and accompanying Google Slides 
Presentations will be 5-min pre-recorded video based on Google Slides
Slides should cover data gathering, exploratory data analysis, modeling approach, finalized results (visualizations and/or metrics), and implications / recommendations for stakeholders
Annotated GitHub
Nice markdown file
For each notebook, include text so people can understand what you are doing and why 
Please note that the GitHub repo should be public
Executive Summary (1 page maximum)
More than your actual code and modeling, companies want to see how your results will help them. This is the type of information they are looking for in job interviews
Questions to address: How do your results impact the KPIs of the business? What recommendations do you have for the stakeholders? 


[Current Timeline]

(20th May)
In our last meeting we discussed the next steps in the project.  Our overall question or goal to answer is along the lines of :

Why do clinical trials fail? (Broad)

Competing therapies?
Eligibility criteria?
Different phases?
Safety?
Efficacy?

We will be doing the following this week:

Data Sources (https://clinicaltrials.gov/)
EDA 

Future discussion at next meeting:

Methods

Random forests
NLP
Neural Networks
